# Ethereum-APIs-For-NFTs
This repository contains common NFT APIs that are designed to work with both ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens, leveraging the web3.js library. These APIs provide a standardized way to interact with NFT smart contracts, making it easier for developers to build applications that involve non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
